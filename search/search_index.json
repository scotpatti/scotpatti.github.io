I've had the privilege to play both as an amateur and a professional. I've met and played with some of the top trumpet players in the world at an international Brass workshop. There I got to meet some of the greats such as Arturo Sandoval, Uan Rasey, Claude Gordon, Timofei Dokschitzer and many others. I am still playing, but certainly don't consider myself to be a professional anymore.</p>"},{"location":"hobbies/#snow-skiing","title":"Snow Skiing","text":"<p>I had a great run skiing basically my whole life and still indulge.

I grew up part of my life on property that used to be a WWII training airport for P51 Pilots named Thunderbird B. In the back of the WWII hanger were 2 P51 Mustangs still in their original shipping crates. I always wanted to learn to fly since I was a kid, so naturally, I chose to learn to fly. Now, both my wife and I are private pilots. </p>"},{"location":"hobbies/#white-water-rafting","title":"White Water Rafting","text":"<p>My wife and I own Aire Tomcat Tandom rafts that we love to play on white water. Our highest achievement in this area is the Middle Ocoee river which we have run multiple times. I will say that swimming hell's hole was one of the worst, but only slightly worse than washer machine or table saw. Videos are on youtube (just not the me swimming part).</p>"},{"location":"hobbies/#moutain-biking","title":"Moutain Biking","text":"<p>... Yeah, we've done that too.

But not anymore (too old). In my younger years I climbed Pinnacle Peak (then just outside of Scottsdale, AZ - now a Park in Scottsdale).
