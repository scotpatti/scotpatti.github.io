Hi, I'm Scot - a professor of Computer Science at [Southern Adventist University](https://www.southern.edu/people/scot) . At various times in my life, I have taught Gradeschool, Highschool, College and Grad School. Since this is my GitHub page, it is primarily dedicated to my work in CS and IT. However, I've had a lot of fun in life and you can see that on my [hobbies](hobbies) page. 

I'm primarily involved in one big project right now: [oiclearning.com](https://oiclearning.com), where our goal is to put teachers back into teaching and let them avoid technology wrangling and grading.
