# Hobbies

Asside from being a Computer Science professor, I have many other hobbies that I indulge in.

## Music

I've played Euphonium since I was 5 years old. I've had the privilege to play both as an amateur and a professional. I've met and played with some of the top trumpet players in the world at an international Brass workshop. There I got to meet some of the greats such as Arturo Sandoval, Uan Rasey, Claude Gordon, Timofei Dokschitzer and many others. I am still playing, but certainly don't consider myself to be a professional anymore.

## Snow Skiing

I had a great run skiing basically my whole life and still indulge. I'm not a Warren Miller wanna be, but I did make up to 50 at 50. That is, 50 MPH at age 50. Never did do snow boarding. 

## SCUBA Diving

Started in College and completed my Centry dive (100 dives) in the Bahamas 2024. I've got to say, the beaches and people in the out islands in the Bahamas are the best! 

## White Water Rafting

My wife and I own Aire Tomcat Tandom rafts that we love to do white water on even still. Our highest achievement in this area is the Middle Ocoee river which we have run multiple times. I will say that swimming hell's hole was one of the worst, but only slightly worse than washer machine or table saw. Videos are on youtube (just not the me swimming part).

## Moutain Biking

... Yeah, we've done that too. Winter Park, Keystone, and many other areas in California, Idaho, Washington and Arizona. 

## Rock Climbing

... Yeah, we've done that too. But not anymore (too old). In my younger years I climbed Pinnacle Peak (then just outside of Scottsdale, AZ - now a Park in Scottsdale). But we've done lots of climbing in Arizona, California (Joshua Tree National Park is my favorite) and in Texas. 

## Sailing

Recently we gave sailing a try and earned our bareboat certifcation. I don't claim to be a real expert on this, but we thoroughly enjoyed learning how to sail.
